# Binary Search Trees

## 1. Draw a BST
- Given the data 3,1,4,6,9,2,5,7, if you were to insert this into an empty binary search tree, what would the tree look like? (Draw the tree, no coding needed here.)
- Draw the BST with the keys - E A S Y Q U E S T I O N

## 2. Remove the root

Show how the above trees would look like if you deleted the root of each tree. (Draw the trees, no coding needed here.)

## 3. Create a BST class
Walk through the binary search tree code in the curriculum and understand it well. Then write a BinarySearchTree class with its core functions (insert(), remove(), find()) from scratch.

- Create a binary search tree called BST and insert 3,1,4,6,9,2,5,7 into your tree. Compare your result with the result from the 1st exercise.
